Styleworker
===========

Doing web development, it's useful to alter the stylesheet in the browser.
This gives us the benifit of seeing the changes live, unfortunately the changes
are lost on reload. The idea here is to see the differences in the stylesheet so
they can be saved.

This is only at proof of concept stage.
